## Release Notes

This release introduces two schema changes. Groups are now Teams, and User has been split off into a Person entity that can be connected to a User.

- A Person has Team memberships, which are automatically created on import from GitHub.
- A User can be associated with multiple Person records, allowing them to navigate between Team relationships and the owned components.
- The User record is required to authenticate them when logging in. In most cases this is automatically created by our Client Portal application.

Also in this release we have a new Team Activity view. This is the place to look to for details on the code, docs, and platform components owned by the team, with additional information about GitHub repositories.
