## Release Notes

This release has two sets of internal changes that will prepare us for some exciting future updates!

### Schema

- Datacenters can now be linked together with `dependsOn` relations
- Platform Components can now belong to multiple Platforms. They also now have a `type` and `subtype`.

### Front-end

We upgraded the main application to use React 18 and Material UI v5. In the process, a lot of the internal components were cleaned up and some front-end bugs that made things look a little glitchy got resolved. We have big plans for our user experience, and this upgrade means we're ready to go forward. Stay tuned for more!
