We have some new features for this release:

## Dotfiles

The CodeComponentSidecar YAML is being replaced by a dotfile format. This allows us to better merge user-created data with automated CodeComponent imports from repositories. You can read more about [how to use dotfiles](https://docs.opencontext.com/docs/catalog/how-to/add-dotfiles) in the docs.

- Add dotfile processor for adding data to imported code components
- Deprecate CodeComponentSidecar now that dotfiles can be used to merge data for imported CodeComponents

## GitHub Actions integration

We're releasing a new GitHub Action soon that will allow you to generate SBOMs and track them in OpenContext.

- Add SBOM type for AuxComponents

Also some bugfixes and other improvements:

## GitHub CodeComponent import

- Add error logging to paginated GitHub GraphQL queries
- Add rate limit logging for GitHub APIs
- Add a 1 sec wait to queryWithPaging to avoid GitHub's secondary rate limit. This change makes 1 request per second to avoid concurrency issues.

## Misc.

- Add runbook type to AuxComponent
