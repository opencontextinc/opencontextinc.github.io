It's time! We're releasing our [GitLab integration](https://docs.opencontext.com/docs/configuration/locations#gitlab). This will allow you to import catalog YAML files from GitLab project repositories. OpenContext will also create a CodeComponent record for the repo and attach any codeowners.

This is just a first release, so we're very interested in your feedback. [Sign up for the beta](https://portal.app.opencontext.com/landing) and get in touch with us if you'd like to try it out.

## Features

- Import projects, users, and groups from GitLab
- Add reference field with copy button functionality to Entity About Cards
- Add config option to import archived GitHub repositories. Set `integrations.github.includeArchived` to `true` to use this.

## Bugs

- Merge links from multiple AuxComponent sources for AuxInfoCard
