# Features

We're in the process of expanding our login options to connect with the services we know customers depend on. For the first piece of this, we now have GitHub login available in the app.

This release also brings in a new data integration: we're scanning GitHub repositories for Snyk and Datadog config files, in order to give you visibility into which projects are using those guardrails and who might need some support to get it integrated.

Plus one more bit of cleanup:

- Add subtype to Platform Component table view and clean up unused columns for Person and Team

This gives you a more streamlined catalog view to find the details you care about fast.
