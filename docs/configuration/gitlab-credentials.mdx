# GitLab credentials

OpenContext can be used to import projects and YAML catalog files from GitLab. In order to do this, an [access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) must be provided.

## Personal Access Token

Using this token, you can import all groups and projects the user has access to, allowing you to see them in OpenContext. 

Make sure `read_api` permissions are set.

It will also import catalog YAML files. See [Locations -> GitLab](../configuration/locations#gitlab) for more.

**SaaS customers**: these secrets can be uploaded to our [Client Portal](../getting-started/client-portal) by your organization's admin user.

**Self hosted customers**: your admin needs to configure the token in the app as detailed in our [docs for self-hosted, Kubernetes cluster installation](../getting-started/selfhosted-install#gitlab-credentials).

Example config:

```yaml
app:
  gitlab:
    enabled: true
    authType: token
    token: ${GITLAB_TOKEN}
```

## Project and Group Tokens

Some GitLab license tiers allow the creation of [project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html) or [group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) scoped tokens. Your OpenContext instance can only use one token at a time, so these options may be less useful in most situations.
