# GitHub credentials

OpenContext can import information from GitHub in order to show you how your repositories and teams are interconnected. 

To do this, OpenContext needs either a personal access token or GitHub app credentials with the right permissions for your organization. 

Once this is set up, you can view:

- Repository information such as languages, releases, contributors, etc.
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)

**SaaS customers:** these secrets are uploaded to our [Client Portal](../getting-started/client-portal) by your organization's admin user.

**Self hosted customers:** your admin needs to configure the token in the app as detailed in our [docs](../getting-started/selfhosted-install#github-credentials).

## Personal Access Token

:::info The GitHub token is used to read information for ALL GitHub orgs provided!
:::

:::caution With Github, only personal access tokens (classic) can access the GraphQL API at this time. [Fine-grained tokens are not supported](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/622).
:::

To import using this method, you'll need to create a **classic** [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

To read software components, include the following permissions:

- repo

To read organization data, include the following permissions:

- read:org
- read:user
- user:email

If you have SAML enabled for your GitHub organization you will also need to follow the following steps to grant your token access to your organization:

[GitHub Docs: Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

## GitHub app

Alternately, you can choose to [create a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app) with the permissions below:

To read software components:

- Actions: Read-only
- Checks: Read-only
- Code scanning alerts: Read-only
- Commit statuses: Read-only
- Contents: Read-only
- Dependabot alerts: Read-only
- Deployments: Read-only
- Discussions: Read-only
- Environments: Read-only
- Issues: Read-only
- Metadata: Read-only
- Packages: Read-only
- Pages: Read-only
- Projects: Read-only
- Pull requests: Read-only
- Secret scanning alerts: Read-only

To read organization data:

- Events: Read-only
- Members: Read-only

To read account data:

- Email addresses: Read-only
- Interaction limits: Read-only

Once the application is created, you have to generate a private key for the application and place it in a YAML file. The YAML file must include the following information:

- **appId (required)**: Generated for you when you create the GitHub app
- **installationId (required)**: The `installationId` can be found by going to `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/installations`
  and clicking on `Configure` next to the GitHub app. The installation id is at the end of the URL you are sent to. For instance, `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/installations/12345678`
  has an `installationId` of `12345678`.
- **clientId (required)**: Generated for you when you create the GitHub app
- **clientSecret (required)**: Generated for you when you create the GitHub app
- **privateKey**: Please note that indentation for `privateKey` is required!

The YAML file can also include the following optional information:

- **allowedInstallationOwners (optional)**: list of GitHub orgs which can use this GitHub app credential. If this is not specified then all GitHub orgs will use the same credentials.
- **webhookUrl (optional)**: Generated for you when you create the GitHub app
- **webhookSecret (optional)**: Generated for you when you create the GitHub app

Example github-app.yaml

```yaml
appId: app id
installationId: installation_id_number
allowedInstallationOwners: ['YOUR_GITHUB_ORG']
clientId: client id
clientSecret: client secret
webhookSecret: webhook secret
privateKey: |
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ...Key content...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```
