# PagerDuty credentials

You can display PagerDuty information for an entity by integrating with OpenContext. 

With just a simple PagerDuty Service ID, you can display relevant PagerDuty information about an entity, including active incidents, on-call responders' profiles, recent changes, and escalation policies.

In order to trigger an incident to the currently on-call responder(s), OpenContext needs a PagerDuty API key (specifically, an Events API V2 integration key). This key also provides the same benefits that you can get from a Service ID. 

**SaaS customers:** these secrets are uploaded to our [Client Portal](../getting-started/client-portal) by your organization's admin user.

**Self hosted customers:** your admin needs to add configure the key in the app as detailed in our [docs](../getting-started/selfhosted-install#pagerduty).

## What this provides

- The PagerDuty credentials allow PagerDuty information about an entity to be displayed within OpenContext. This includes active incidents, recent change events, as well as the current on-call responders' names, email addresses, and links to their profiles in PagerDuty.
- Change events will be displayed in a separate tab. If the change event payload has additional links, only the first link will be rendered.
- Incidents can be manually triggered with a user-provided description, which will in turn notify the current on-call responders.
  :::info This feature is only available when providing the `pagerduty.com/integration-key` annotation

## Integrating with a PagerDuty service

There are two ways of integrating an entity with PagerDuty. 

1. The first way is through an [integration key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#generate-a-new-integration-key). An integration key allows OpenContext users to manually trigger an incident with a user-provided description. This will notify their current on-call responders. 

2. The second is through the PagerDuty Service ID. This will not allow manual triggering of incidents and will not notify current on-call responders. 

### Get an Events integration key from PagerDuty

Whether this is for a new service or an old one, you'll start on the PagerDuty Configuration menu. 

Once there, select Services -> Service Directory. Then, follow the instructions below.

#### Existing Services

If you're adding the OpenContext integration to a new service:

- Click the name of the service you want to integrate. 
- Select the `Integrations` tab and click the `Add another integration` link.
- Look for the PagerDuty `Events API V2` integration. Click the checkbox and then click the `Add` button. You will be redirected back to the `Integrations` tab for the service.
- Under the `Integrations` section look for `Events API V2` and click on the gear icon. This will bring you to a page that will show you the `Integration Key`. 
- Take note of this key and keep it in a safe place since it will be used for configuring the integration with OpenContext in the next [section](#adding-the-pagerduty-annotation-to-an-entity).

#### New Services

If you want to integrate a new service, please read the PagerDuty documentation for [Services and Integrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-configuring-services-and-integrations). 

You can then follow the steps outlined in the [Create a Service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service) section, selecting the PagerDuty `Events API V2` as the Integration Type in step 5. 

Continue with the [Adding the PagerDuty annotation to an entity](#adding-the-pagerduty-annotation-to-an-entity) (below) once you have finished these steps.

### Get the PagerDuty Service ID from PagerDuty

:::info Manually triggering an incident is not supported using this method.
:::

To get your Service ID:
- For an existing service, go to the PagerDuty Configuration menu and pick Services -> Service Directory.
- For a new service, check the PagerDuty steps outlined in their [Create a Service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service) documentation.

Once a service is created:

- Click on the service name for the Service ID you need
- Your URL should end in something like `pagerduty.com/service-directory/TEST7XW`. In this case `TEST7XW` is the PagerDuty Service ID. Make note of this since it will be needed when [Adding the PagerDuty annotation to an entity](#adding-the-pagerduty-annotation-to-an-entity) (below).

### Adding the PagerDuty annotation to an entity

#### Using a PagerDuty integration key

```yaml
apiVersion: opencontext.com/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformComponent
metadata:
  name: retail-vm
  description: Blue Sky / Retail virtual machine
  annotations:
    pagerduty.com/integration-key: 'e0efde5a1somethingorother'
spec:
  type: vm
  lifecycle: production
  owner: [it-ops]
  service: retail
  datacenter: [aws, gcp]
  dependsOn:
    ['platform-component:wholesale-lb', 'platform-component:wholesale-secrets']
  dependencyOf: ['code-component:retail-app', 'code-component:retail-backend']
  priority: 1
  sla: 24x7
```

#### Using a PagerDuty Service ID

:::info The feature to manually trigger an incident is not supported using this method.
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: opencontext.com/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformComponent
metadata:
  name: retail-dns
  description: Blue Sky / Retail DNS
  annotations:
    pagerduty.com/service-id: 'TEST7XW'
spec:
  type: dns
  lifecycle: production
  owner: [it-ops]
  service: retail
  datacenter: [gcp]
  dependencyOf:
    [
      'code-component:retail-app',
      'code-component:retail-backend',
      'platform-component:wholesale-lb',
      'platform-component:wholesale-secrets',
    ]
  priority: 1
  sla: 24x7
```
