# Kind: PlatformComponent

This kind of entity describes the infrastructure a platform needs to operate, like BigTable databases, Pub/Sub topics, S3 buckets or CDNs. Modeling them together with code components and platforms allows you to visualize your platform components' footprint, and create tooling around them.

## Definition

:::tip A key that ends with a question mark is optional.
For example, `spec.priority`
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: opencontext.com/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformComponent
spec:
  type: string
  lifecycle: string
  owner: string[]
  dependsOn?: string[]
  dependencyOf?: string[]
  service?: string
  uri?: string
  priority?: number
  sla?: string
  datacenter?: string[]
```

- **apiVersion**: opencontext.com/v1alpha1 [required]
- **kind**: PlatformComponent [required]
- **metadata**: ([ObjectMeta](common#metadata)) [optional]
  Standard objectâ€™s metadata. For more information see the [Common to All Kinds](common) doc
- **spec**: ([Spec](#spec)) [required]
  Specification to describe the infrastructure a service needs to operate, like BigTable databases, Pub/Sub topics, S3 buckets or CDNs. Modeling them together with code components and services allows it to visualize platform components' footprint, and create tooling around them.

## Spec

- **type** (string) [required]
  The type of platform component.
  For example: database, loadbalancer, cluster, server, vm, blob storage, network switch, firewall, ssl certificate
- **lifecycle** (string) [required]
  The lifecycle state of the component.
  For example: experimental, staging, production, deprecated.
- **owner** (string array) [required]
  An array of [entity references](entity-reference) to the owner of the datacenter. Default entity type is [Kind: Team](team).
  For example: cloud-team, person:sean
- **dependsOn** (string array) [optional]
  An array of [entity references](entity-reference) to other entities that the platform component depends on to function.
- **dependencyOf** (string array) [optional]
  An array of [entity references](entity-reference) to other entities that the platform component is a dependency of.
- **service** (string) [optional]
  An [entity reference](entity-reference) to the [service](service) that the platform component belongs to. Default entity type [Kind:Service](service).
- **uri** (string) [optional]
  A component's URI / FQDN.
  For example: [https://jenkins.example.com](https://jenkins.example.com/)
- **priority** (number) [optional]
  Priority of 1-5 to fix component with 1 being the highest.
- **sla** (string) [optional]
  The SLA of the component.
  For example: 24x7, 24x5
- **datacenter** (string array) [optional]
  An array of [entity references](entity-reference) to the [datacenter](datacenter) that the code component belongs to. Default entity type [Kind:Datacenter](datacenter).
