# Welcome

Welcome to OpenContext!

The OpenContext application is made up of two parts, the Client Portal and the main application. The Client Portal is used for registration and user configuration / secret management. The main application uses the registration data from the Client Portal to log the user into the main application and to show their profile to other users in the system. The main application is only made available to a user once they have been registered through the Client Portal.
